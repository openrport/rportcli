# Rport CLI (v1)

Rport CLI is a tool to help you managing your remote machines connected 
to the [rport API](https://github.com/cloudradar-monitoring/rport) directly from your terminal.

The rport command line interface `rportcli` is a great addition to the rport server. Executing some tasks on the
command line can be much faster and more efficient than doing it on the web user interface.

Rportcli does not cover all functions of the user interface. On the other hand, you can do things on the command line,
you cannot do on the user interface.

Integrates well with:
